# Power_BI_Procurement_Spend_Analysis
ðŸ“¦ Procurement Spend Analysis Dashboard
A visual breakdown of company-wide purchasing activityâ€”from suppliers and packaging types to color preferences and seasonal trends. This Power BI dashboard uncovers spending patterns across millions of units and billions in purchases.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This dashboard was built using:

Power BI Desktop â€“ For creating the report visuals and interactions.

Power Query â€“ For transforming messy procurement data into something digestible.

DAX â€“ To calculate totals, breakdowns, and percentages for all those billions and millions.

Relational Data Model â€“ Combined multiple tables like stock items, suppliers, and POs for clean cross-filtering.
